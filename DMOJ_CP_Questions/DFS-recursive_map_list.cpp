Output:

Following is Depth First Traversal (starting from vertex 2)
2 0 1 9 3
Complexity Analysis:

Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
Space Complexity: O(V).
Since an extra visited array is needed of size V.
 Handling Disconnected Graph

Solution: This will happen by handling a corner case.
The above code traverses only the vertices reachable from a given source vertex. All the vertices may not be reachable from a given vertex, as in a Disconnected graph. To do a complete DFS traversal of such graphs, run DFS from all unvisited nodes after a DFS.
The recursive function remains the same.
